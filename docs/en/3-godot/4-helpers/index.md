# Helpers

As seen in the [usage](../2-usage.md) section, the Clyde interpreter has as simple interface giving you full control on how to display and handle your dialogues. This allows endless possibilities, which might be overwhelming for new developers or people on a rush.

To help you quick start a project, I included a few helpers with this plugin. By enabling the helpers option in `ProjectSettings`, a `Dialogue` singleton and a `ClydeDialogueConfig` node will be available, allowing a quick start with no much effort.

You can find usage examples in the [addon examples folder](https://github.com/viniciusgerevini/godot-clyde-dialogue/tree/godot_4/addons/clyde/examples).

This implementation comes with a simple fixed dialogue bubble and a floating dialogue bubble. You can adapt these helpers however you need. If you intend to change them, I recommend copying them to your project's folder so there are no conflicts when updating the plugin.
