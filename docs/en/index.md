# Clyde Dialogue

Clyde is a language for writing game dialogues. It supports branching, translations and interfacing with your game through variables and events.

```

The Wolf:   Jimmie – lead the way, boys – get to work.
Vincent:    A "please" would be nice.
The Wolf:   Come again?
Vincent:    I said a "please" would be nice.
The Wolf:   Get it straight, Buster. I'm not here to
            say "please."I'm here to tell you what to
            do. And if self-preservation is an
            instinct you possess, you better f****n'
            do it and do it quick. I'm here to help.
            If my help's not appreciated, lotsa luck
            gentlemen.
Jules:      It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your help is
            definitely appreciated.
Vincent:    I don't mean any disrespect. I just don't
            like people barkin' orders at me.
The Wolf:   If I'm curt with you, it's because time is
            a factor. I think fast, I talk fast, and I
            need you guys to act fast if you want to
            get out of this. So pretty please, with
            sugar on top, clean the f****n' car.
